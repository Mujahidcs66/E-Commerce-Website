# E-Commerce-Website
 
This project involves the creation of an E-commerce Website as a virtual platform. The website offers users a catalog of diverse products that can be bought from the store. To facilitate online shopping, a shopping cart is included for user convenience. Once the user selects the desired items, they are directed through the order confirmation process. The implementation of this system is carried out utilizing the Django web framework in Python.
